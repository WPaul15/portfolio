			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
				I am a fifth-year student at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering and German. I expect to
				graduate in May 2020. I currently have an interest in front-end development, but I am always open to
				learning new things. In three adjectives, I am creative, detail-oriented, and open-minded.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides programming, I play guitar and trombone, I sing, I dabble in writing, I love learning languages,
				I ski (though living in Iowa, it's hard to do so), and I enjoy video and board games.
			</p>

					<h2>
						Willem? Like Willem Dafoe?
					</h2>
					<p class="no-spacing">
						Yes. Although his given name is actually <i>"William"</i>. Mine is <i>"Willem"</i>. You can
						pronounce it "WILL-um" (how English-speakers&mdash;myself included&mdash;say it) or "VILL-ehm"
						(how it should actually be pronounced). It's the Dutch version of the name <i>"William"</i>,
						akin to the German <i>"Wilhelm"</i>.

					<h2>Why did you choose software engineering?</h2>
					<p class="no-spacing">
						To me, computer science is too theoretical and computer engineering is too "physical", so to
						speak. Ever since my sophomore year of high school I knew I wanted to study something
						software-related. After learning about software engineering, I knew that it was what I wanted to
						study. I think software engineering is the perfect balance of technical and soft skills. I enjoy
						coding, no doubt, but I also enjoy creating and designing software on a higher level. I like the
						idea of working with clients to gather system requirements because I don't want to end up in a
						position where the products I create don't have immediate impact on peoples' lives. I want to
						use software to make a difference in the world and I feel I can do that best through software
						engineering.

					<h2>What are you going to do with German?</h2>
					<p>
						I began learning German in high school. When I got to ISU, I knew I wanted to continue learning
						German and taking courses, so I did. A classmate in my first German course told me about the
						Languages and Cultures for Professions (LCP) Program and how it would be a perfect fit for me.
						The LCP Program offers a specialized second major or minor to students in the Colleges of
						Engineering, Business, or Agriculture and Life Sciences that better prepares them for work in
						our globalized workforce. It really was the perfect fit for me: It aligns well with my personal
						goals, allows my German course credits to count towards something, allowed me to study abroad in
						Salzburg, Austria for a year, and will continue to open many doors for me in the future. I hope
						to eventually find work in a German-speaking country.
					</p>
					<p>
						Learning another language has a lot of benefits besides just knowing another set of vocabulary
						and different grammar. It has also helped me be more confident in my speaking, both in English
						and in other languages. I've also increased my cultural awareness and global competency, i.e. I
						now have a better sense of how to interact with people from other cultures and I appreciate our
						differences more.

					<p class="no-spacing">Maybe. Maybe not. Have you tried turning it off and back on?</p>
